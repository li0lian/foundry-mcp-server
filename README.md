# Foundry MCP Server

A simple, lightweight and fast MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides Solidity development capabilities using the Foundry toolchain (Forge, Cast, and Anvil).

![Foundry MCP Demo](./assets/analysis_gif.gif)

## Overview

This server connects LLM assistants to the Foundry ecosystem, enabling them to:

- Interact with nodes (local Anvil instances or remote RPC endpoints)
- Analyze smart contracts and blockchain data
- Perform common EVM operations using Cast
- Manage, deploy, and execute Solidity code and scripts
- Work with a persistent Forge workspace

## Features

### Network Interaction

- Start and manage local Anvil instances
- Connect to any remote network (just specify the RPC)
- Get network/chain information

### Contract Interaction

- Call contract functions (read-only)
- Send transactions to contracts (if `PRIVATE_KEY` is configured)
- Get transaction receipts
- Read contract storage
- Analyze transaction traces
- Retrieve contract ABIs and sources from block explorers

### Solidity Development

- Maintain a dedicated Forge workspace
- Create and edit Solidity files
- Install dependencies
- Run Forge scripts
- Deploy contracts

### Utility Functions

- Calculate contract addresses
- Check contract bytecode size
- Estimate gas costs
- Convert between units (hex to decimals, etc.,)
- Generate wallets
- Get event logs
- Lookup function and event signatures

## Usage

The server is designed to be used as an MCP tool provider for MCP Clients. When connected to a client, it enables the clients(claude desktop, cursor, client, etc.,) to perform Solidity and onchain operations directly.


#### Requirements

- [Node.js v18+](https://nodejs.org)
- [Foundry toolchain](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) (Forge, Cast, Anvil)
  
### Manual Setup

1. Ensure Foundry tools (Forge, Cast, Anvil) are installed on your system:
   ```
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   ```
2. Clone and build the server.

    ```sh
    bun i && bun build ./src/index.ts --outdir ./dist --target node
    ```
   
3. Update your client config (eg: Claude desktop):

```json
 "mcpServers": {
    "foundry": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "path/to/foundry-mcp-server/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env" :{
        "PRIVATE_KEY": "0x1234",
      }
    }
 }
```

> [!NOTE]
> `PRIVATE_KEY` is optional 


### Setup using NPM Package
- Coming soon  

#### Configuration

The server supports the following environment variables:

- `RPC_URL`: Default RPC URL to use when none is specified (optional)
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key to use for transactions (optional)

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not add keys with mainnet funds. Even though the code uses it safely, LLMs can hallicunate and send malicious transactions. 
> Use it only for testing/development purposes. DO NOT trust the LLM!!

### Workspace

The server maintains a persistent Forge workspace at `~/foundry-mcp-server/workspace` for all Solidity files, scripts, and dependencies.

## Tools

## Usage in Claude Desktop App ðŸŽ¯

Once the installation is complete, and the Claude desktop app is configured, you must completely close and re-open the Claude desktop app to see the tavily-mcp server. You should see a hammer icon in the bottom left of the app, indicating available MCP tools, you can click on the hammer icon to see more details on the available tools.

Now claude will have complete access to the foundry-mcp server. If you insert the below examples into the Claude desktop app, you should see the foundry-mcp server tools in action.

### Examples

1. **Transaction analysis**:
```
Can you analyze the transaction and explain what it does? 
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcb73ad3116f19358e2e649d4dc801b7ae0590a47b8bb2e57a8e98b6daa5fb14b
```

2. **Querying Balances**:
```
Query the mainnet ETH and USDT balances for the wallet 0x195F46025a6926968a1b3275822096eB12D97E70.
```
3.  **Sending transactions**:
```
Transfer 0.5 USDC to 0x195F46025a6926968a1b3275822096eB12D97E70 on Mainnet. 
```

4. **Deploying contracts**:
```
Deploy a contract using one of the existing deployment scripts in the workspace.
```

### Using Existing Deployment Scripts

The workspace comes with pre-configured deployment scripts for common token standards that should be used for deployment instead of creating new ones:

1. **Deploy ERC20 Token**:
```
Start a local Anvil instance and deploy an ERC20 token using the deploy_erc20 tool:
deploy_erc20 name="My Token" symbol="MTK" initialSupply="1000000" rpcUrl="http://localhost:8545"
```

2. **Deploy ERC721 Token (NFT)**:
```
Deploy an ERC721 NFT collection using the deploy_erc721 tool:
deploy_erc721 name="My NFT Collection" symbol="MNFT" tokenId="42" rpcUrl="http://localhost:8545"
```

3. **Deploy ERC1155 Token (Multi-token)**:
```
Deploy an ERC1155 multi-token contract using the deploy_erc1155 tool:
deploy_erc1155 name="My Multi Token" symbol="MMT" tokenIds="100,200,300" quantities="50,25,10" baseUri="https://myapi.com/tokens/" rpcUrl="http://localhost:8545"
```

These tools provide standardized deployments by automatically using the corresponding deployment scripts:

- **deploy_erc20**: Uses DeployTestERC20.s.sol script to deploy an ERC20 token (required parameters: name, symbol; optional parameter: initialSupply)
- **deploy_erc721**: Uses DeployERC721.s.sol script to deploy an NFT collection (required parameters: name, symbol; optional parameter: tokenId)
- **deploy_erc1155**: Uses DeployERC1155.s.sol script to deploy a multi-token contract (required parameters: name, symbol; optional parameters: tokenIds, quantities, baseUri)

Most parameters have defaults from the scripts and are optional, but name and symbol are required to ensure proper token identification.

### Simplified Approach: Direct Use of forge_script

For more flexibility, you can also use the `forge_script` tool directly to run the deployment scripts with environment variables:

#### 1. ERC20 Token Deployment

```bash
# Using default values
forge_script scriptPath="script/DeployTestERC20.s.sol" rpcUrl="http://localhost:8545" broadcast=true

# Using custom values via environment variables
TOKEN_NAME="My Custom Token" TOKEN_SYMBOL="MCT" TOKEN_SUPPLY="5000000" \
forge_script scriptPath="script/DeployTestERC20.s.sol" rpcUrl="http://localhost:8545" broadcast=true
```

#### 2. ERC721 Token Deployment

```bash
# Using default values
forge_script scriptPath="script/DeployERC721.s.sol" rpcUrl="http://localhost:8545" broadcast=true

# Using custom values via environment variables
NFT_NAME="My NFT Collection" NFT_SYMBOL="MNFT" NFT_TOKEN_ID="42" \
forge_script scriptPath="script/DeployERC721.s.sol" rpcUrl="http://localhost:8545" broadcast=true
```

#### 3. ERC1155 Token Deployment

```bash
# Using default values
forge_script scriptPath="script/DeployERC1155.s.sol" rpcUrl="http://localhost:8545" broadcast=true

# Using custom values via environment variables
ERC1155_NAME="My Multi Token" ERC1155_SYMBOL="MMT" ERC1155_TOKEN_IDS="100,200,300" ERC1155_QUANTITIES="50,25,10" ERC1155_BASE_URI="https://my-api.com/tokens/" \
forge_script scriptPath="script/DeployERC1155.s.sol" rpcUrl="http://localhost:8545" broadcast=true
```

The deployment scripts have been updated to read parameters from environment variables with sensible defaults, making them easy to use without modification.

You can also use the `forge_script` tool directly to run these scripts with more configuration options:

```
forge_script scriptPath="script/DeployTestERC20.s.sol" rpcUrl="http://localhost:8545"
```
